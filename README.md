## A63 CRUD

This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed in Node.js that uses a JSON file as a database. The application allows users to be created with a name and password, and once created, they can create posts. Each user will have their `userId` associated with each post.

The application was developed to provide a simple interface for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting users and their respective posts.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: Backend development platform.
- Express.js: Web framework for Node.js that facilitates the creation of routes and APIs.
- JSON: File format used as the database to store users and posts.
- HTML and JavaScript: Used in the frontend to interact with the backend through HTTP requests.
